So to begin experimenting with osTicket, I first logged into a dummy account as a user to create a ticket.

<p>
After creating the ticket I would then log back into the main account to inspect the ticket and see whether or not to assign it to a certain department, set the sla, and even change the priority level if need be.

<p>
As the ticket is being worked on there is a section that displays the different updates made to the ticket similar to a history tab.

<p>
  After resolving the tickets issue, I made a final statemtent on the ticket and updated the ticket as resolved making it dissapear from the active tickets section.
